== Checking the Connection to the :product-title: Server

In some organizations, a single person might be responsible for scanning IT resources. However, in others, multiple people using different machines might hold this responsibility, so multiple instances of the command line tool might be needed. Any additional :product-title: users who did not install the :product-title: server and command line tool must ensure that the command line tool instance is configured to connect to the server and that the user name can log in to the command line interface.
