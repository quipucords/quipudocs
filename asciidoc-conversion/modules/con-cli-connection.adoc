== Configuring the :product-title_cmd: command line tool connection

After the :product-title: server is running, you can configure the :product-title_cmd: command line tool to work with the server. When the command line tool is configured, you can log in to :product-title: with the command line interface and begin setting up and running scans on your IT infrastructure.

The '+:product-title_cmd: server config+' command configures the connection between the :product-title_cmd: command line tool and the :product-title: server.

The '+:product-title_cmd: server config+' command takes the following options:
* The '+--host+' option is required. If you are using the :product-title_cmd: command line interface on the same system where the server is running, you can supply the loopback address '+127.0.0.1+' as the value. Otherwise, supply the IP address for your :product-title: server.
* The '+--port+' option is optional. The default value for this option is '+9443+'. If you decided to remap the :product-title: default exposed server port to another port, the port option is required. You must supply the port option and the remapped value in the command, for example, '+--port 8443+'.
