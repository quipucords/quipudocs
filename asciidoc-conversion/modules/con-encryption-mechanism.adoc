== Encryption Mechanism

The encryption uses the secret key for the Quipucords server. The secret key for the server is generated during the initial server start process and resides in the directory that is mapped to '+/var/data/+'. If you chose the default configuration options for the Quipucords server, the secret key is in the following location: '+~/quipucords/data/secret.txt+'.
