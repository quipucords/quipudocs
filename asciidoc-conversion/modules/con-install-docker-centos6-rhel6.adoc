== Installing Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 6.6 or later

To install Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS 6.6 or later, you must have kernel 2.6.32-431 or later installed.

To check the current kernel release, open a terminal session and use the uname command to display the kernel release information, as shown in the following example:

----
# uname -r
----

The output of this command is similar to the following example:

----
2.6.32-573.el6.x86_64
----

[NOTE]
====
After you confirm that you have at least the minimum required kernel release, it is recommended that you fully update your system. Having a fully patched system can help you avoid kernel bugs that have already been fixed on the latest kernel packages.
