== Merging Systems

After Quipucords determines that two systems are duplicates, it performs a merge. The merged system has a union of system facts from each source. When Quipucords merges a fact that appears in both systems, it uses the following order of precedence to merge the fact, from highest to lowest:

. Network
. Satellite
. vCenter


A system fingerprint contains a '+metadata+' dictionary that captures the original source of each fact for that system.
