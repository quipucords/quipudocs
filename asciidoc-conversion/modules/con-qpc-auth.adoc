== Quipucords Authentication

Communication with the Quipucords server uses an authentication token. When you enter the '+qpc server login+' command, you are prompted for the server user name and password. The login command exchanges the user name and password, which are encrypted and transmitted to the server over HTTPS, for the authentication token. The authentication token is then used for all subsequent commands in that session. An authentication token expires when you log out of that session. It also expires on a daily basis.
