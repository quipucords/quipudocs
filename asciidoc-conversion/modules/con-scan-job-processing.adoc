== Scan Job Processing

When the scan job runs the connection task for a source, it attempts to connect to the network, server for vCenter Server, or server for Satellite. If the connection to vCenter Server or Satellite fails, then the connection task fails. For a network scan, if the network is not reachable or the credentials are invalid, the connection task reports zero (0) successful systems. If only some of the systems for a network scan are reachable, the connection task reports success on the systems that are reachable, and the connection task does not fail.

When the scan job runs the inspection task for a source, it checks the state of the connection task. If the connection task shows a failed state or if there are zero (0) successful connections, the scan job transitions to the failed state. However, if the connection task reports at least one successful connection, the inspection task continues. The results for the scan job then show success and failure data for each individual system. If the inspection task is not able to gather results from the successful systems, or if another unexpected error occurs during the inspection task, then the scan job transitions to the failed state.

If a scan contains multiple sources, each source has its own connection and inspection tasks. These tasks are processed independently from the tasks for the other sources. If any task for any of the sources fails, the scan job transitions to the failed state. The scan job transitions to the completed state only if all scan job tasks for all sources complete successfully.
