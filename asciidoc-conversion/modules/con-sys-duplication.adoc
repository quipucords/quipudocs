== System Deduplication and Merging

You can gather system information by using one or more of the following types of sources for a scan:

* Network
* vCenter
* Satellite

A single system can be found in multiple sources during a scan. For example, a virtual machine on vCenter Server could be running a Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system installation that is also managed by Satellite. If you construct a scan that contains a vcenter, satellite, and network source, then that single system is reported by all three vcenter, satellite, and network sources during the scan.

To resolve this issue and build an accurate fingerprint, Quipucords feeds unprocessed system facts from the scan into a fingerprint engine. The fingerprint engine matches and merges data for systems that are found in more than one source by using the deduplication and merge processes.
