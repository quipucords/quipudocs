Adding CLI Inputs with Backslashes
A single backslash is used as an escape character in both Shell and Python, which can cause undesired values if only one backslash is present. Therefore, CLI inputs containing a backslash will need to be escaped with another backslash \\. For example if you wanted to add a credential with the username '+Domain\Username+', the value would have to be escaped:

----
# qpc cred add --type vcenter --name ActiveDirectory --username Domain\\Username --password
----
