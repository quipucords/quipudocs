== Creating a Satellite Source

.Procedure
. Create at least one satellite credential. Enter the password of the user with access to the Satellite server at the connection password prompt.
+
----
# qpc cred add --type satellite --name cred_name --username satellite_user --password
----

. Create at least one satellite source that specifies the host name or IP address of the Satellite server, one satellite credential to be used for the scan:
+
----
# qpc source add --type satellite --name source_name --hosts host_name --cred cred_name
----

For example, for a satellite source where the source name is '+mysatellite6+', the Satellite server is located at the '+192.0.2.15+' IP address, and the satellite credential for that server is '+satellite_admin+', you would enter the following command:

# qpc source add --type satellite --name mysatellite6 --hosts 192.0.2.15 --cred satellite_admin

IMPORTANT]
====
By default, sources are scanned with full SSL validation, but you might need to adjust the level of SSL validation to connect properly to the Satellite server. The '+source add+' command supports options that are commonly used to downgrade the SSL validation. The '+--ssl-cert-verify+' option can take a value of '+False+' to disable SSL certificate validation; this option would be used for any server with a self-signed certificate. The Satellite server does not support disabling SSL, so the '+--disable-ssl+' option has no effect.
