== Creating a scan

After you set up your credentials and sources, you can run a :product-title: scan to inspect your IT environment. You can create a scan on a single source or combine sources, even sources of different types.

.Procedure

Create the scan by using the scan add command, specifying a name for the name option and one or more sources for the sources option:
+
----
# :product-title_cmd: scan add --name scan1 --sources source_name1 source_name2
----

For example, if you want to create a scan called myscan with the network source mynetwork, you would enter the following command:
+
----
# :product-title_cmd: scan add --name myscan --sources mynetwork
----
