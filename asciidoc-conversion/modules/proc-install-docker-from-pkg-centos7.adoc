.Procedure

. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/[CentOS 7 Packages]. For the Docker version that you want to install, download the RPM package to the intended installation system.

# sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm
----

+
----
# sudo docker run hello-world
