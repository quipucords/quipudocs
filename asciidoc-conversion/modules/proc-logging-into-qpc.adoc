== Logging in to the :product-title_cmd: Server

After the connection between the :product-title_cmd: command line tool and the :product-title_cmd: server is configured on the system where you want to use the command line interface, you can log into the server and begin using the command line interface to run the :product-title_cmd: commands that set up and run scans.

.Procedure

. To log in to the server, enter the following command:
+
----
# :product-title_cmd: server login
----

. Enter the server user name and password at the prompts. The default login is admin and the password is '+pass+'.

The '+:product-title_cmd: server login+' command retrieves a token that is used for authentication with subsequent command line interface commands. That token is removed when you log out of the server, and expires daily.
