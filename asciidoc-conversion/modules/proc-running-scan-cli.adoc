== Running a Scan

After a scan is created, you can run it. You can run a scan multiple times. Each instance of a scan is assigned a unique identifier, and is known as a scan job.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Scans run consecutively on the Quipucords server, in the order in which the '+qpc scan+' start command for each scan is entered.

.Procedure
Run the scan by using the '+scan start+' command, specifying the name of a scan for the '+name+' option:
+
----
# qpc scan start --name scan_name1
----

. For example, if you want to run the scan '+myscan+', you would enter the following command:
+
----
# qpc scan start --name myscan
----
