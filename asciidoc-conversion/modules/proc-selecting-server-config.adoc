== Selecting the :product-title: Server configuration options

When you run the command to start the :product-title: server, you supply values for several options that affect the configuration of that server. You must make the following decisions:

* Accepting or changing the default exposed server port
* Selecting a directory for SSH keys
* Selecting a directory for the SQLite database
* Selecting a directory for log output
* Accepting or changing the default postgres user by specifying :product-title_cmd:_DBMS_USER
* Accepting or changing the default postgres password by specifying :product-title_cmd:_DBMS_PASSWORD

.Procedure

** Accept or change the default exposed server port to use for HTTPS communication. By default, the server exposes port 9443, which is the standard HTTPS port. You can choose to use that port or remap the port to be used on your server.
** If you select to expose port '+9443+', you would use the following option when you run the Docker command to start the server: '+-p 9443:443+'.
** If you want to remap the port on your system, you would supply a new value for the port when you run the Docker command to start the server. The syntax of this option is '+-p <host_port>:<container_port>+'. For example, to remap the port to '+8443+', you would enter the following option in the command: -p 8443:443. Additionally, Docker supplies an option to select a free port for all exposed ports by using the '+-P+' option; the port mapping is then available from the '+sudo docker ps+' command.

. Select values for the directory for SSH key and the directory for the log output. The most efficient way to configure these options is to create a home directory for the :product-title: server and then use that home directory for each of these three options.

.. Create the home directory. The following example command creates the home directory '+~/quipucords+':
+
----
# mkdir -p ~/quipucords
----

.. Change to that home directory. For example:
+
----
# cd ~/quipucords
----

.. Create subdirectories to house the SSH keys, ('+~/quipucords/sshkeys+'), database ('+~/quipucords/data+'), and log output ('+~/quipucords/log+'). For example:
+
----
# mkdir sshkeys
# mkdir log
----

. Accept or change the default variables used to configure and access the PostgreSQL Database:

** :product-title_cmd:_DBMS_PASSWORD (Optional) The database password for Postgres. By default, the password is set to '+password+'. We recommend that you change it by using the following option when you run the Docker command to start the server: '+":product-title_cmd:_DBMS_PASSWORD=yourPass"+'.
** :product-title_cmd:_DBMS_USER (Optional) The database user for Postgres. By default, the user is set to '+postgres+'.
*** If you select to keep the user as '+postgres+', no option is needed when you run the Docker command to start the server.
*** If you select to specify a different user, you would use the following option when you run the Docker command to start the server: '+":product-title_cmd:_DBMS_USER=yourUser"+'.
