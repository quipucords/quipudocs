== Showing Scan Job Status

When you run the '+scan+' start command, the output provides an identifier for that scan job. You can show the status of the '+scan job+' by using the scan job command and specifying the provided identifier.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The '+scan job+' command can show results only after the scan job starts running. You can also use this command on a scan job that is completed. 

.Procedure

. For example, you could run the following scan as the first scan in your environment:
+
----
# qpc scan start --name myscan
----

. The output for the command shows the following information, with '+1+' listed as the identifier:
+
----
Scan "1" started
----

. To show the scan status, you would enter the following command:
+
----
# qpc scan job --id 1
----

The output of this command includes the status of the scan job, the start time of the scan job, and (if applicable) the end time of the scan job.
