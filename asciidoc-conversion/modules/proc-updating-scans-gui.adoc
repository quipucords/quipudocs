= Updating scans

After you name a scan and run it for the first time, it is added to the Scans view. You can then run a new instance of that scan, or _scan job_, to update the data that is gathered for that scan.

.Prerequisites

// no prereqs? To update a scan, you must run it at least once--seems pretty no duh. is this needed?

.Procedure

. From the Scans view, click the btn:[Run Scan] icon in the scan details.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  In the scan details, if the first or most recent scan job did not complete successfully, this icon is labeled btn:[Retry Scan].

.Verification steps

When the scan process begins, a notification displays with a message about the progress of the scan.

. In the scan details, expand btn:[Previous] to view all previous scan jobs.
