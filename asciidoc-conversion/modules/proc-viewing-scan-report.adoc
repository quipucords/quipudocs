== Viewing the scan report

When the scan job completes, you have the capability to produce a report for that scan job. You can request a report with all the details, or facts, of the scan, or request a deployments report. The deployments report process runs steps to merge the facts found during the inspection of the various hosts that are contacted during the scan. When possible, the report process also runs steps to deduplicate redundant systems. For both types of reports, you can produce the report in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format or comma-separated values (CSV) format.

To generate a deployments report, enter the '+:product-title_cmd: report deployments+'  command and specify the identifier for the scan job and the format for the output file.

.Example 1

If you want to create the deployments report for a scan with the scan job identifier of 1 and you want to generate that report in CSV format in the '+~/scan_result.csv+' file, you would enter the following command:

----
# :product-title_cmd: report deployments --scan-job 1 --csv --output-file=~/scan_result.csv
----

.Example 2

If you want to create the detailed report, you would use the '+:product-title_cmd: report details+' command. This command takes the same options as the'+:product-title_cmd: report deployments+' command. The output is not deduplicated and merged, so it contains all facts from each source. For example, to create the detailed report for a scan with the scan job identifier '+1+' with CSV output in the '+~/scan_result.csv+' file, you would enter the following command:

----
# :product-title_cmd: report details --scan-job 1 --csv --output-file=~/scan_result.csv
----
