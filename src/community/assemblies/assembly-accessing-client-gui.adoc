= Accessing the {ProductNameShort} user interface

You access the {ProductNameShort} graphical user interface through a browser connection.
ifdef::qpc_install_guide,discovery_install_guide[]
You access the command line interface by running a command to connect to the server.
endif::qpc_install_guide,discovery_install_guide[]

To use the {ProductNameShort} user interface, the system on which you want to run the user interface must be able to communicate with the system on which the {ProductNameShort} server is installed.
