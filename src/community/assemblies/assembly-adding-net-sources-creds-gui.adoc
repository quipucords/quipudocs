= Adding network sources and credentials

To run a scan on one or more of the physical machines, virtual machines, or containers on your network, you must add a source that identifies each of the assets to scan. Then you must add credentials that contain the authentication data to access each asset.

// .Prerequisites
// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
// * Text can be a link to a pre-requisite task that the user must do before starting this task.

.Procedure

Add one or more network sources and credentials to provide the information needed to scan the assets in your network. To learn more, see the following information:

* To add a network source, see xref:proc-adding-net-sources-gui_{context}[Adding network sources].
* To add a network credential, see xref:proc-adding-net-creds-gui_{context}[Adding network credentials].

To learn more about sources and credentials and how {ProductNameShort} uses them, see the following information:

* xref:con-about-sources-creds-gui_assembly-adding-net-sources-creds-gui-ctxt[About sources and credentials]

To learn more about how {ProductNameShort} authenticates with assets on your network, see the following information. This information includes guidance about running commands with elevated privileges, a choice that you might need to make during network credential configuration:

* xref:con-net-auth-gui_{context}[Network authentication]
* xref:ref-commands-used-net-scans-gui_{context}[Commands that are used in scans of remote network assets]

// do you need level offset in each assembly? at master doc level only? confused about this one.
