= Adding sources and credentials

To prepare {ProductNameShort} to run scans, you must add the parts of your IT infrastructure that you want to scan as one or more sources. You must also add the authentication information, such as a username and password or SSH key, that is required to access those sources as one or more credentials. You add sources and credentials according to the type of source that you are going to scan.

// .Prerequisites

// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.

.Procedure

As part of the general process of adding sources and credentials that encompass the different parts of your IT infrastructure, you might need to complete a number of tasks.

Add network sources and credentials to scan assets such as physical machines, virtual machines, or containers in your network. To learn more, see the following information:
