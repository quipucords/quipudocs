= Adding sources and credentials

To prepare Quipucords to run scans, you must add the parts of your IT infrastructure that you want to scan as one or more sources. You must also add the authentication information, such as username and password or SSH key, that is required to access those sources as one or more credentials. You add sources and credentials according to the type of source that you are going to scan.

.Prerequisites

// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
