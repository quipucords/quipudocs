= Adding vcenter sources and credentials

To run a scan on a {vCenterServerName} deployment, you must add a source that identifies the {vCenterServerName} server to scan. Then you must add a credential that contains the authentication data to access that server.

// .Prerequisites
// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
// * Text can be a link to a pre-requisite task that the user must do before starting this task.
