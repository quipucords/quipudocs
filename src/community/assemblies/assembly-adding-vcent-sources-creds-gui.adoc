= Adding vcenter sources and credentials

To run a scan on a {vCenterServerName} deployment, you must add a source that identifies the {vCenterServerName} server to scan. Then you must add a credential that contains the authentication data to access that server.

// .Prerequisites
// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
// * Text can be a link to a pre-requisite task that the user must do before starting this task.

.Procedure

Add a vcenter source and credential to provide the information needed to scan {vCenterServerName}. To learn more, see the following information:

* To add a vcenter source, see xref:proc-adding-vcent-sources-gui_{context}[Adding vcenter sources].
* To add a vcenter credential, see xref:proc-adding-vcent-creds-gui_{context}[Adding vcenter credentials].

To learn more about sources and credentials and how {ProductNameShort} uses them, see the following information:

* xref:con-about-sources-creds-gui_assembly-adding-vcent-sources-creds-gui-ctxt[About sources and credentials]

To learn more about how {ProductNameShort} authenticates with your {vCenterServerName} server, see the following information. This information includes guidance about certificate validation and SSL communication choices that you might need to make during vcenter credential configuration:
