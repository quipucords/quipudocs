= Installing {ProductNameShort} with the offline installation process

The offline installation process is required when you install {ProductNameShort} on a machine that does not have Internet access, also commonly referred to as an offline, air-gapped, or disconnected environment. The information in this section describes the installation process when you are installing the {ProductToolsName}, the server, and the command line interface (CLI) tool in this type of environment.

When you run the offline installation process, the server and CLI packages are installed with the default options. However, you can change some of the defaults used by the installation process by setting options that are defined in xref:ref-tools-install-options-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Options for the {ProductToolsName} install command].

ifdef::qpc_install_guide[]
For the offline installation process, you must complete some steps from a _connected_ machine, one that has Internet connectivity. These steps include downloading the {CompanyName} Package Manager (RPM) package for {ProductToolsName}, downloading the server and CLI packages, building a container image for the database, transferring packages to the disconnected machine, and others. You also complete steps on the _disconnected_ machine, including installing dependencies to enable the offline installation, receiving the prepared packages and images transferred from the connected machine, and running the installer itself.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that all prerequisites are installed and configured.

* Ensure that the connected machine where you download packages can connect to the disconnected machine or machines where you want to install {ProductToolsName} and the {ProductNameShort} server and CLI tool.

.Procedure

ifdef::discovery_install_guide[]
To install {ProductNameShort} with the offline installation process, you do the following tasks:

. THE DISCOVERY OFFLINE INSTALL STEPS ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.

. Run the installation. For more information, see xref:proc-installing-scripted-offline-qpc-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Installing with the offline installation process].

[NOTE]
====
This installation process installs {ProductNameShort} with default settings for all of the options. However, other settings are available for you to customize your installation. For more information about these settings, see xref:ref-tools-install-options-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Options for the {ProductToolsName} install command].

ifdef::qpc_install_guide[]
To install {ProductNameShort} with the offline installation process, you do the following tasks:

. Install dependencies on the connected and disconnected machine, as required. These dependencies are additional required software that cannot be installed by {ProductToolsName} in an offline installation process. For more information, see xref:proc-installing-dependencies-offline-install-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Installing dependencies for the offline installation].
. Download the {ProductToolsName} package to the connected machine. For more information, see xref:proc-downloading-tools-package-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Downloading the {ProductToolsName} package].
. Download the server package to the connected machine. For more information, see xref:proc-downloading-server-package-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Downloading the server package].
. Build the database container image. For more information, see xref:proc-building-database-container-image-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Building the database container image].
. Download the CLI package to the connected machine. For more information, see xref:proc-downloading-cli-package-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Downloading the command line interface package].
. Transfer the packages from the connected machine to the disconnected machine where you are going to run the installation. For more information, see xref:proc-transferring-packages-offline-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Transferring packages to the offline machine].
. Run the installation. For more information, see xref:proc-installing-scripted-offline-qpc-inst_assembly-installing-scripted-offline-inst-ctxt[Installing with the offline installation process].
