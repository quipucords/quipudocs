= Merging and downloading reports

After you run a scan, you can download the reports for that scan to view the data that was gathered and processed during that scan.

If you choose to divide the scanning tasks for your IT infrastructure into several discrete scans, you can merge the output of those scans into a single report. Merged reports are also downloaded at the time of merging.
