= Running and managing scans

After you add sources and credentials for the parts of your IT infrastructure that you want to scan, you can create and run scans. When you create a scan, you can choose to scan a single source or combine multiple sources of any type. You can also choose whether to run a standard scan for products that are installed with default installation processes and locations or to run a deep scan if products might be installed with nonstandard processes or locations.

After a scan is created, you can run that scan multiple times. Each instance of that scan is saved as a scan job.
