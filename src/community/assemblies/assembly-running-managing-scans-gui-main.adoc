= Running and managing scans

After you add sources and credentials for the parts of your IT infrastructure that you want to scan, you can create and run scans. When you create a scan, you can choose to scan a single source or combine multiple sources of any type. You can also choose whether to run a standard scan for products that are installed with default installation processes and locations or to run a deep scan if products might be installed with nonstandard processes or locations.

After a scan is created, you can run that scan multiple times. Each instance of that scan is saved as a scan job.

// .Prerequisites
// * (keeping here temporarily, but probably not using this section in this topic)
// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
// * Text can be a link to a pre-requisite task that the user must do before starting this task.

To learn more about running a deep scan, a scan that can find products that might have been installed with a nonstandard process or in a nonstandard location, see the following information:
