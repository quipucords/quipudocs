= Running and managing standard scans

After you add sources and credentials for the parts of your IT infrastructure that you want to scan, you can begin running scans. In most situations, you can run a standard scan to find the environment and product data that is required to report on your {CompanyName} products.

// .Prerequisites
// * Sentence or a bulleted list of pre-requisites that must be in place or done before the user starts this task.
// * Delete section title and bullets if the task has no required pre-requisites.
// * Text can be a link to a pre-requisite task that the user must do before starting this task.

.Procedure

Run a standard scan to find products in standard locations. To learn more, see the following information:

* xref:proc-running-scans-standard-gui_{context}[Running standard scans]

When you begin running scans, there are several tasks that you can do to manage your scans. These tasks include updating the data for a scan by running a new scan job and managing active scans by pausing, resuming, and canceling them. To learn more, see the following information:

* xref:proc-running-new-scan-job-gui_assembly-running-managing-scans-standard-gui-ctxt[Running a new scan job]
* xref:proc-pause-resume-cancel-scans-gui_assembly-running-managing-scans-standard-gui-ctxt[Pausing, resuming, and canceling scans]

To learn more about how scans and scan jobs work, including how a scan job is processed by {ProductNameShort} and the states a scan job moves through during its life cycle, see the following information:
