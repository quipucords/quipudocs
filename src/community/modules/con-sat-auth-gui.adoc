= Satellite Server authentication

For a satellite scan, the connectivity and access to Satellite Server derives from basic authentication (user name and password) that is encrypted over HTTPS. By default, the satellite scan runs with certificate validation and secure communication through the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. During source creation, you can select from several different SSL and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to use for the certificate validation and secure communication.

You might need to adjust the level of certificate validation to connect properly to the Satellite server during a scan. For example, your Satellite server might use a verified SSL certificate from a certificate authority. During source creation, you can upgrade SSL certificate validation to check for that certificate during the a scan of that source. Conversely, your Satellite server might use self-signed certificates. During source creation, you can leave the SSL validation at the default so that scan of that source does not check for a certificate, possibly resulting in scan errors.

You might also need to disable SSL as the method of secure communication during the scan if the Satellite server is not configured to use SSL communication for web applications. For example, your Satellite server might be configured to communicate with web applications by using HTTP with port 80. If so, then during source creation you can disable SSL communication for scans of that source.
