= vCenter Server authentication

For a vcenter scan, the connectivity and access to vCenter Server derives from basic authentication (user name and password) that is encrypted over HTTPS. By default, the vcenter scan runs with certificate validation and secure communication through the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. During source creation, you can select from several different SSL and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to use for the certificate validation and secure communication.

You might need to adjust the level of certificate validation to connect properly to the vCenter server during a scan. For example, your vCenter server might use a verified SSL certificate from a certificate authority. During source creation, you can upgrade SSL certificate validation to check for that certificate during the a scan of that source. Conversely, your vCenter server might use self-signed certificates. During source creation, you can leave the SSL validation at the default so that scan of that source does not check for a certificate. This choice, to leave the option at the default for a self-signed certificate, could possibly avoid scan errors.

You might also need to disable SSL as the method of secure communication during the scan if the vCenter server is not configured to use SSL communication for web applications. For example, your vCenter server might be configured to communicate with web applications by using HTTP with port 80. If so, then during source creation you can disable SSL communication for scans of that source.
