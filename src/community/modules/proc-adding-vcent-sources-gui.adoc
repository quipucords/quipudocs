.Procedure

+
The Add Source wizard opens.

. On the Type page, select *vCenter Server* as the source type and click *Next*.

. On the Credentials page, enter the following information.
.. In the *Name* field, enter a descriptive name.
.. In the *IP Address or Hostname* field, enter the IP address or host name of the vCenter Server for this source. Enter a different port if you do not want a scan for this source to run on the default port 443. For example, if the IP address of the vCenter Server is 192.0.2.15 and you want to change the port to 80, you would enter `192.0.2.15:80`.
// NOTE: 80 is just a guess...
.. In the *Credentials* list, select the credential that is required to access the vCenter Server for this source. If a required credential does not exist, click the *Add a credential* icon to open the Add Credential wizard.
.. In the *Connection* list, select the SSL protocol to be used for a secure connection during a scan of this source. Select *Disable SSL* to disable secure communication during a scan of this source.
.. If you need to upgrade the SSL validation for the vCenter Server to check for a verified SSL certificate from a certificate authority, select the *Verify SSL Certificate* check box.
. Click *Save* to save the source and then click *Close* to close the Add Source wizard.
