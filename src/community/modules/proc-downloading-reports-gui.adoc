.Prerequisites

If you want to download a report for a scan, the most recent scan job for that scan must have completed successfully.

.Procedure

. From the Scans view, navigate to the row of the scan for which you want to download the report.
. Click btn:[Download] for that scan.

.Verification steps

// the report_id____ID___DATE_TIME_.tar.gz string renders correctly in preview
// do not change underscore coding
The downloaded report is saved to the downloads location for your browser as a [filename]`.tar.gz` file, for example, [filename]`report_id_224_20190702_173309.tar.gz`. The file name format is [filename]`report_id____ID___DATE_TIME_.tar.gz`, where `_ID_` is the unique report ID assigned by the server, `_DATE_` is the date in _yyyymmdd_ format, and `_TIME_` is the time in the _hhmmss_ format, based on the 24-hour system. The date and time data is determined by the interaction of the browser that is running the client with the server APIs.

// the report_id______ID_ string renders correctly in preview
// do not change underscore coding
To view the report, uncompress the [filename]`.tar.gz` file into a [filename]`report_id______ID_` directory. The uncompressed report bundle includes four report files, two details reports in CSV and JSON formats, and two deployments reports in CSV and JSON formats.
