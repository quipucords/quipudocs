= Enabling and installing {AnsibleName} and {ProductToolsName}
endif::discovery_install_guide[]

The {ProductToolsName} package includes tools that you use to install and maintain {ProductNameShort}.

ifdef::discovery_install_guide[]
The {ProductToolsName} installation process integrates with an {AnsibleName} playbook to complete the installation. Therefore, {AnsibleName} version 2.4 or later (depending on the requirements of your operating system) is a depenency for {ProductToolsName}. As part of the installation process, {ProductToolsName} installs {AnsibleName}, but you must manually enable the required repositories for {AnsibleName}.

// .Prerequisites

// Before you begin, review the prerequisites for {ProductNameShort}.

.Procedure

// change steps to not auto-start installing from docs link

ifdef::discovery_install_guide[]
. Enable the {RHELNameShort} {AnsibleEngineName} repositories. For more information about this step, see the instructions for enabling repositories for the limited support version of {AnsibleName} in the "How do I Download and Install Red Hat Ansible Engine? Customer Portal article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/3174981[^] For more detailed information about {AnsibleName}, see https://docs.ansible.com/#coreversionselect[^].

[NOTE]
====
The procedure at this link includes a step to install {AnsibleName}. Because {ProductToolsName} installs {AnsibleName} for you, running the command to install {AnsibleName} is not required.
====

. Register your system to {RHSMName}:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
# subscription-manager register

. Use the following command to help you find the {ProductNameShort} subscription and then note the pool ID of the subscription:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
# subscription-manager list --available

. Attach the subscription, where `_pool_ID_` is the pool ID for the {ProductNameShort} subscription.
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes,+quotes"]
# subscription-manager attach --pool=_pool_ID_

. Enable the {ProductNameShort} repository:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
# subscription-manager repos --enable discovery-0-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

. Install {ProductToolsName}:
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
# yum install {ProductToolsName}

endif::discovery_install_guide[]

ifdef::qpc_install_guide[]
. Install {ProductToolsName} by using the following command, based on your operating system version:
* For {RHELNameShort} 8, use the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes]
{QPCcommandInstallToolsRHEL8}
* For {RHELNameShort} 7 and {CentOSName} 7, use the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes]
{QPCcommandInstallToolsRHEL7}
* For {RHELNameShort} 6 and {CentOSName} 6, use the following command:
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes]
{QPCcommandInstallToolsRHEL6}
