= Pausing, resuming, and canceling scans

As you begin running scans, you might need to stop a scan job that is currently running. There might be various business reasons that require you to do this, for example, the need to do an emergency fix due to an alert from your IT health monitoring system or the need to run a higher priority scan that consumes more CPU resources if a lower priority scan is currently running.

You can stop a scan job by either pausing it or canceling it. You can resume a paused scan job, but you cannot resume a canceled scan job.

.Procedure

To pause a scan job that is running:

. From the Scans view, find the scan that contains the scan job that you want to pause.
. Click *Pause Scan*.

If you have multiple scans running at the same time, it might take several moments after starting a scan for the *Pause Scan* icon to appear.

. Click *Resume Scan*.
