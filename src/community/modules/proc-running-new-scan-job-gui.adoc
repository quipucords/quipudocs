= Running a new scan job

After you name a scan and run it for the first time, it is added to the Scans view. You can then run a new instance of that scan, or scan job, to update the data that is gathered for that scan.

.Prerequisites

// no prereqs? To update a scan, you must run it at least once--seems pretty obvious from the intro. is this needed?

.Procedure

. From the Scans view, click the *Run Scan* icon in the scan details.

[NOTE]
====
In the scan details, if the most recent scan job did not complete successfully, this icon is labeled *Retry Scan*.

.Verification steps

When the scan process begins, a notification displays with a message about the progress of the scan.

. In the scan details, expand *Previous* to view all previous scan jobs.
