= Running scans with deep scanning
// If this topic gets used, should the majority of it become conditionalized text to reuse across both scanning topics?

You can run a new scan from the Sources view. You can run a scan for a single source or select multiple sources to combine into a single scan. As part of scan configuration, you might choose to use the deep scanning process to search for products in nonstandard locations.

The deep scanning process uses the `find` command, so the search process could be CPU resource intensive for the systems that are being scanned. Therefore, you should use discretion when selecting a deep scan for systems that require continuous availability, such as production systems.

After you run a scan for the first time, the scan is saved to the Scans view. From that view, you can run the scan again to update its data.

.Prerequisites

* To run a scan, you must first add the sources that you want to scan and the credentials to access those sources.

.Procedure

. From the Sources view, select one or more sources. You can select sources of different types to combine them into a single scan.

. Click the *Scan* button that is appropriate for the selected sources:
  * For a single source, click *Scan* on the row for that source. Selecting the check box for the source is optional.
  * If you selected multiple sources, click *Scan* in the toolbar.
  The Scan wizard opens.

. In the *Name* field, enter a descriptive name for the scan.

. If you want to change the default number of maximum concurrent scans, set a new value in the *Maximum concurrent scans* field. This value is the maximum number of machines or virtual machines that are scanned in parallel during a scan.

. To use the deep scanning process on one or more products, supply the following information:
  * Select the applicable *Deep scan for these products* check boxes.
  * Optionally, enter the directories that you want {ProductNameShort} to scan. The default directories that are used in a deep scan are the `/`, `/opt`, `/app`, `/home`, and `/usr` directories.

. To begin the scan process, click *Scan*.

.Verification steps
When the scan process begins, a notification displays in the Sources view. The running scan also displays in the Scans view, with a message about the progress of the scan.

// .Additional resources
// * A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module.
// * Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
