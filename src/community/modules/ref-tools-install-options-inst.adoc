= Options for the {ProductToolsName} install command

The installation procedures in this guide install the {ProductNameShort} server and CLI packages with all of the default options. However, the `install` subcommand that installs the {ProductNameShort} server and command line interface packages includes options to customize the installation process.

The following information lists the `install` subcommand options, along with applicable usage information and default values, for the server and CLI packages.

== Server installation options

ifdef::qpc_install_guide[]
`--offline-files=_offline_files_path`:: Sets the fully qualified path to the files on the disconnected machine, for example, the transferred server and command line interface packages, that are needed to complete an offline installation. This option has no default value and is used only when specified during an offline installation.
endif::qpc_install_guide[]

`--version=_version.patch.release_`:: Enables the installation of a specific {ProductNameShort} server version. Contains the semantic versioning format (version.release.patch, such as 0.9.0) of the {ProductNameShort} server that you want to install. This option has a default of the latest version.
ifdef::qpc_install_guide[]
This option is required if the `offline-files` option is specified.

`--home-dir=_server_home_dir_`:: Sets the fully qualified path to the installation directory for the {ProductNameShort} server. Defaults to `~/{ProductInCommands}/`.

`--port=_server_port_`:: Sets the port number for the {ProductNameShort} server. Defaults to `9443`.

`--open-port=true|false`:: Determines whether to open the port in the firewall during the installation. This option enables communication between the {ProductNameShort} server and any remote clients over the port defined in the `port` option. Contains a true or false value. Defaults to true. Supply `false` to install without opening the server port in the firewall. The installation script must run with elevated privileges to open the server port.
